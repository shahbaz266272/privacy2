        utilize encryption, secure protocols, and access controls to safeguard
        your data. However, please note that no method of transmission over the
        internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee
        absolute security.

        The App may contain links to third-party websites or services, such as
        online retailers or payment processors. We are not responsible for the
